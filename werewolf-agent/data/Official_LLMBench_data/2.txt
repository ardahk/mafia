🎭 Game Master : 🏛️ The village gathers to elect its mayor... But who can truly be trusted? Werewolves may be hiding among the candidates...


🏛️ === MAYOR ELECTION ===

📋 Before starting the game, the village elects a mayor.
 Mayor's power: in case of tie during elimination votes, his choice prevails.

📝 === ELECTION ROUND 1 ===

📝 Phase: Candidacies and public justifications

💬 Phase: Candidacies and public justifications

[Liam] - Candidacy and justification round
🤔 [Liam's reasoning] I’m the Witch. Taking mayor gives me control over tiebreaks and helps prevent a wolf mayor. It increases night-kill risk, but I can self-save if needed; ideally I save for seer or myself N1 if targeted. I’ll keep the death potion for a solid wolf read or confirmed info. Early leadership will help me read interactions and guide votes without outing my role.
  ✅ Liam is running
  🎤 Liam : I’m running for mayor. Day 1 can get messy fast, and I want a clear, structured approach so wolves can’t exploit confusion. My commitments: 1) I’ll share my vote intention early with reasons and won’t last‑second flip without explanation. 2) I’ll ask everyone to give one suspect and one townread with short reasoning to build a readable record. 3) If there’s a tie, I’ll break it based on contribution, consistency, and vote history—not at random. 4) Seer should stay hidden unless you have a strong result and are under real pressure. If you want a mayor who keeps notes, is accountable, and will make the tough call when needed, I’m your pick.

[Jules] - Candidacy and justification round
🤔 [Jules' reasoning] Avoid drawing attention; let Liam take mayor to stay hidden and let Diana and I manipulate later votes from the shadows.
  ➖ Jules is not running
 
[Hugo] - Candidacy and justification round
🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] I’m VT and want to avoid a potential wolf mayor. Running creates vote data and pressures Liam; if he’s a wolf, this makes it harder for him to gain uncontested control. If I win, I’ll use transparent criteria and track intentions to spot wolfy opportunism. If I lose, the vote distribution and reasoning are alignment-indicative.
  ✅ Hugo is running
  🎤 Hugo : I’m running for mayor. In a 6-player game with 2 wolves, ties and thin info are common—we can’t afford a wolf steering tiebreaks. My approach: 1) I’ll state my vote intention early with a confidence percentage and won’t switch without new stated reasons. 2) Each day I’ll ask everyone for one suspect, one townread, a brief why, and a ‘vote-now’ target—short, comparable, and trackable. 3) I’ll keep a living PoE with criteria so my decisions are predictable and never random. 4) I won’t push power roles to out—Seer claims only if you have a strong result and are under real pressure; Witch conserve unless saving from a wolf kill or you have a clear, high-value shot. 5) On tiebreaks, I’ll prioritize eliminating the least transparent/most inconsistent player or the flip that best clarifies vote networks. I’ll state my criteria before deciding and give room for brief counters. I’ll also actively track timing of vote-intention shifts to catch opportunism. Whether or not I’m your pick, let’s at least adopt this structure so wolves can’t hide behind chaos.

[Bob] - Candidacy and justification round
🤔 [Bob's reasoning] I won’t run. As the Seer, staying low-profile D1 reduces night-kill risk and preserves my investigative value. I can still influence structure and votes without the tiebreak power. Between the current candidates, I slightly prefer Hugo’s transparent, trackable framework and living PoE over Liam’s broader plan. I’ll likely support Hugo unless new information flips my read.
  ➖ Bob is not running

[Diana] - Candidacy and justification round
🤔 [Diana's reasoning] Staying out of the mayor race keeps me low‑key and avoids drawing extra attention. Let the villagers fight over the position while I focus on covert wolf actions.
  ➖ Diana is not running

[Oscar] - Candidacy and justification round
🤔 [Oscar's reasoning] Two strong candidates already laid out clear, testable frameworks. Adding myself would just split the field and reduce clarity. I’ll stay out, evaluate Liam vs. Hugo on transparency, consistency, and concrete tiebreak criteria, then hold the winner accountable. Slight lean Hugo for the more explicit PoE and timing-tracking, but I’ll finalize after their next statements and vote rationale.
  ➖ Oscar is not running

✅ Candidacy and justification phase completed! Candidates: Liam, Hugo

📋 Confirmed candidates: Liam, Hugo

🗳️ Voting phase (Round 1)
🤔 [Liam's reasoning] Both platforms are solid, but I trust my own alignment and process more than Hugo’s unknown. In 6p with 2 wolves, mayoral tie-breaks are huge; I’d rather keep that leverage out of potential wolf hands. Yes, mayorhood raises my nightkill risk, but I can manage that and only self-protect if it’s optimal for village tempo. I’ll use clear criteria (contribution, consistency, vote history) and avoid burning the death potion without strong wolf equity. If Hugo wins anyway, I’ll still support structure and scrutinize his consistency, but my best EV is to keep tie control with me.
🤔 [Jules' reasoning] Both candidates are strong, but voting for Hugo may split the vote and possibly force a tie, giving us a chance to influence the next round. Plus, his detailed tracking could distract the villagers from our own moves.
🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] Self-vote. I’m the only alignment I know is town, while Liam could be a wolf. In a 6p/2w game the mayor’s tie-break is huge; giving it to a confirmed-to-self villager is safer than to an unknown, even if Liam’s platform is solid. My plan is transparent (intentions with confidence, PoE, criteria-based tie-breaks) and reduces wolf opportunism. If I lose, the vote map and reasoning will still be informative and I’ll hold Liam to his commitments.
🤔 [Bob's reasoning] Hugo’s platform is more structured and transparent (confidence, PoE, timing tracking) and explicitly protects power roles from outing, which aligns with village interests and my need to stay hidden. If he’s a wolf, his self-imposed criteria will be easier to hold him accountable to. I’ll watch for any deviation from his stated process as a red flag. Probabilistically, with both Liam and Hugo running, at least one is likely town; I’ll likely use my first vision on a non-candidate (Jules/Diana/Oscar) to widen coverage unless new info changes priorities.
🤔 [Diana's reasoning] I prefer Hugo's detailed tracking and clear criteria, which should keep the discussion organized without being overly rigid, making it easier to steer the village later.
🤔 [Oscar's reasoning] Hugo’s plan is more structured and auditable: confidence-tagged vote intentions, a living PoE with stated criteria, precommitted tie-break rules, and timing-tracking of vote shifts. That reduces wolf room to hide and gives us levers to hold the mayor accountable. Liam’s pitch is solid but more subjective/vague (e.g., ‘contribution/consistency’), which is harder to audit. I’ll back Hugo but will expect him to publish his initial PoE and tie-break criteria immediately and stick to them—any deviation or opportunistic late shift will be a red flag.

🏛️ === END OF MAYOR ELECTION ===


🌙 NIGHT 1

🎭 Game Master: 🔮 The seer wakes up to investigate a player.

🤔 [Bob's reasoning] I initially planned to check a non-candidate (Jules/Diana/Oscar) to widen coverage, but Hugo being elected mayor makes him the highest-leverage target: his tie-break power can decide eliminations, so verifying him early is maximal EV. If he’s a wolf, I can pressure him using his own stated criteria (process transparency, PoE updates, timing of vote-intention shifts) without outing as Seer immediately; if pushback stalls and it’s critical, I can claim late Day 1 or Day 2. If he’s villager, I can treat him as a strong townread privately and work within his structure to sort the rest while staying hidden. Either way, this vision will anchor the village’s direction.
  [SEER CHOICE] Bob chose to investigate Hugo.
  [VISION RESULT] Bob discovers that Hugo is a VILLAGER
🎭 Game Master: 🔮 The seer has finished her nightly preparations. Mystery surrounds her intentions.

🎭 Game Master: 🐺 The werewolves wake up to choose their next victim...


[WOLVES PRIVATE CHANNEL]
Wolves present: Jules, Diana
Possible targets: Liam, Hugo, Bob, Oscar


[Wolf consultation round - 1/4]
  Diana: "Jules, let's take out Oscar. He seems low-key and likely a villager. Removing him reduces numbers and avoids drawing attention by targeting the mayor." + proposes to eliminate Oscar.

  Jules: "I agree with Diana. Oscar seems low‑key and likely a villager. Killing him reduces the village count and keeps the mayor safe for now." + proposes to eliminate Oscar.


[CONSENSUS] Wolves agree on: Oscar
🎭 Game Master: 🐺 The wolves have acted. The village still doesn't know the fate of one of their own.

🎭 Game Master: 🧙‍♀️ The witch wakes up...

🤔 [Liam's reasoning] Save Oscar. In 6p with 2 wolves, letting N1 kill through puts us at 5 (2W/3V) and creates immediate high-pressure lylo-like dynamics where a single miselim can lose the game. A N1 save preserves town numbers, maximizes the Seer’s chance to live and get another peek (Oscar could even be the Seer), and gives us a fuller D1 with more interactions and better odds to catch a wolf. I won’t use the death potion blindly: with zero night info and no D1 interactions yet, a poison shot is more likely to kill a villager (or even the Seer) than hit a wolf, and I can’t both save and poison this same night. I’ll keep the death potion for a high-confidence read or a confirmed-info shot later.
[WITCH] The life potion has been used to save Oscar. 
🎭 Game Master: 🧙‍♀️ The witch has finished her nightly preparations. Mystery surrounds her intentions.

🎭 Game Master: 🌄 Dawn is approaching. The night is coming to an end...


☀️ DAY 1

🎭 Game Master: ☀️ The sun is rising over the village, driving away the shadows of the night...

🎭 Game Master: 💬 Let the discussion begin...

[Speaking round 1]

[THE GM DETERMINES THE SPEAKING ORDER]
Liam → 💬 ANALYSIS
Jules → 💬 ANALYSIS
Hugo → 💬 ANALYSIS
Bob → 💬 ANALYSIS
Diana → 💬 ANALYSIS
Oscar → 💬 ANALYSIS

📋 Speaking order: Hugo → Diana → Bob → Liam → Jules → Oscar

🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] No-kill likely means the Witch saved or wolves risk-managed with a weird line; either way, not worth PR-baiting. I want clear, individual reasoning from the four who voted me; statistically at least one wolf is likely in that bloc. By setting a low-confidence pressure intention on Oscar, I nudge contributions from a quieter archetype without tunneling and leave room to pivot. Liam’s candidacy + self-vote is NAI but slightly town for taking responsibility early; I’ll test him via how he builds PoE and whether he can articulate a tiebreak that doesn’t just mirror mine. Key heuristics to watch: hedging, vote-intention timing, and whether two of the four pile voters show copy‑paste logic. I’ll log each intention and be ready to move the wagon toward the least transparent responder.
[Hugo] Thanks for the trust. No death last night buys us time—let’s use it well. Here’s the plan for Round 1 so we collect clean, comparable info. Each of you please give exactly: 1) One suspect with a one‑line reason, 2) One townread with a one‑line reason, 3) Your vote‑now target with a confidence percentage, 4) For those who voted me over Liam yesterday (Jules, Bob, Diana, Oscar): why did you prefer me? For Liam: why did you prefer yourself and what did you dislike about my platform? If you accuse someone, add one concrete question or behavior you want them to answer today. Power roles: do not out; only claim under real pressure with a strong result. On tiebreaks, I’ll choose based on transparency and consistency, and I’ll state my criteria before deciding. My current take: wolves often hide in comfortable consensus, so until I hear independent reasons, I lightly suspect the pile on me (Jules/Bob/Diana/Oscar). Liam is a slight townlean for offering a structured plan under scrutiny, but not cleared. Current vote intention for pressure only: Oscar at 35% confidence (fully movable). I especially want distinct, non‑parroted reasons from each of Jules, Bob, Diana, and Oscar. Let’s keep intentions updated; no last‑second flips without an explanation.

🤔 [Diana's reasoning] Push suspicion onto Liam and Bob to keep wolves (Jules and me) safe, steer vote away from us, and appear cooperative with the mayor’s structured approach.
[Diana] I’m leaning toward suspecting Liam because his very detailed plan feels a bit over‑engineered – wolves often hide behind overly tidy proposals. My townread is that Oscar’s quiet demeanor could be a cover, but I’m not fully convinced he’s a threat yet. For now I intend to vote for Bob with about 60% confidence; his responses have seemed evasive and he hasn’t offered much concrete reasoning. Hugo, could you clarify why you think the wolves would have targeted Oscar last night rather than someone more central?
🤔 [Bob's reasoning] I have Hugo cleared from my N1 vision (villager), so both wolves are among Liam/Jules/Diana/Oscar. Diana’s post is the scummiest: invented implication about an Oscar night target (possible witch-slip or wolf confusion) and an opportunistic 60% push on me without evidence while naming Liam as her suspect. I’m pressuring her to force clarity without triggering an unnecessary power claim; if she hard-claims Witch with a concrete night target, I’ll reassess and avoid a D1 PR elim. If she can’t reconcile the contradictions, I’ll keep my vote on her. I’m keeping my seer role hidden for now; if I’m pushed to the brink later, I can claim and clear Hugo to reorient the village. Next vision priority depends on today’s posts: if Diana doesn’t claim credibly and survives, I might scan outside her (Oscar/Jules) to widen coverage; if she does claim credibly, I’ll scan within Oscar/Jules/Liam to narrow the PoE.
[Bob] Responding to the mayor’s structure:
1) Suspect: Diana — her post misread Hugo (he never suggested wolves targeted Oscar), and she’s voting me 60% while saying Liam is her main suspect; that mismatch plus calling me “evasive” before I’ve spoken looks opportunistic.
2) Townread: Hugo — early transparent criteria + stated, movable pressure vote and accountability fit a villager mindset.
3) Vote-now target: Diana at 60% (movable with good answers).
4) Why I preferred Hugo over Liam yesterday: tighter, trackable process (confidence + living PoE), explicit anti‑outing posture for PRs, and pre‑committed tie criteria. If he’s scum, those constraints make him easier to catch; if he’s town, they help us organize.
Concrete question to Diana: Please quote where Hugo implied the wolves targeted Oscar last night, and reconcile why your stated suspect is Liam but your elimination vote is me at 60%—what specific behavior of mine are you referring to?
I’ll adjust after hearing from Diana, Oscar, Jules, and Liam. No power claims unless under real pressure with a strong reason.
🤔 [Liam's reasoning] I used the life potion to save Oscar N1; I won’t out that. Keep the death potion for a high-confidence wolf shot or a confirmed-info scenario. Diana’s contradictions (misread of Hugo, hedgy townread on Oscar, early 60% on Bob while naming me main suspect) look like wolfy opportunism. If she flips wolf, partner most likely among Jules/Oscar given their silent pile-on for Hugo; Bob reads town via process, Hugo null-lean town for structure but still possible wolf. Aim to build a solid case on Diana and solicit independent takes from Jules/Oscar to sort them. Avoid outing PRs; keep mayor onside by aligning with transparency criteria.
[Liam] Suspect: Diana — multiple alignment pings: she misrepresents Hugo (he never said wolves targeted Oscar), she calls me her main suspect yet parks a 60% elim on Bob, and she labeled Bob “evasive” before he’d posted substance. Her “townread” on Oscar also reads contradictory (“quiet could be a cover” isn’t town-indicative).

Townread: Bob — clear, falsifiable critique, asks for receipts, keeps vote movable. That’s villager‑oriented process.

Vote-now target: Diana at 65% (movable with strong, specific answers or new info).

Answer to Hugo’s question: I preferred myself for mayor because I trust my own transparency and tie-break criteria; what I disliked in your platform was the early pressure vote on Oscar without a distinct reason beyond consensus dynamics, plus the risk that a rigid PoE locks in too early. That said, I like today’s structure and will follow it.

Questions for Diana:
1) Please quote where Hugo suggested wolves targeted Oscar N1.
2) Explain how “quiet could be a cover” equals a townread on Oscar.
3) Why eliminate Bob when you said I’m your bigger suspect? What exact behavior of Bob was “evasive”?
4) What’s your best explanation for the no-kill (save vs. protection vs. other), and which is most likely and why?

Jules and Oscar: give one concrete behavior each that would make you vote someone right now — not “agree with X,” but your own observation.

I’ll reassess after Diana’s answers and hearing from Jules/Oscar. If Diana can’t reconcile these inconsistencies, I’m comfortable voting there today.

🤔 [Jules' reasoning] I want the village to eliminate Oscar (likely the witch) now, reducing the villagers and keeping Diana safe, while appearing cooperative and logical.
[Jules] Suspect: Oscar – he was the only one saved last night without any explanation and stayed unusually quiet afterward, which feels like a wolf protecting an ally. Townread: Hugo – his methodical approach, willingness to share vote intentions early, and lack of power‑role claims fit a genuine villager mindset. Vote Oscar, 70% confidence (movable). Concrete behavior: Oscar didn’t respond to any of the prompts or questions after the night, remaining silent while everyone else is actively analyzing – a atypical behavior for a villager wanting to help the town.
🤔 [Oscar's reasoning] Best pressure is on Jules: the claim that I was 'the only one saved' is either fabricated or an imprudent PR hint; either way it’s alignment-indicative. I’m leaving a clear path to pivot to Diana if Jules retracts credibly and Diana can’t reconcile her contradictions. Avoid forcing PRs to out: I explicitly say I’m not asking for claims. Goal today: create a clean, testable record and converge on a single wagon between Jules/Diana so wolves can’t hide in split votes. Track late vote shifts for opportunism; if tie risk emerges, prefer flipping the claim-maker (Jules) for maximum clarity.
[Oscar] - Suspect: Jules — he stated as fact that I was “the only one saved last night,” which is unknowable to anyone but the Witch (and even then, outing that publicly would be bizarre). That reads like invented night info to justify a push. He also accused me of being “unusually quiet” when I simply hadn’t had my speaking turn yet.
- Townread: Bob — precise, receipt-seeking questions to Diana, declared a movable vote with clear reasoning. That’s villager process.
- Vote-now target: Jules at 60% confidence (movable). I’ll move if Jules retracts/clarifies the “Oscar was saved” claim as sloppy speculation and provides a transparent process beyond tunneling me. Secondary suspicion: Diana for misreading Hugo, calling Liam her main suspect while parking 60% on Bob, and labeling Bob “evasive” before substance.
- Why I preferred Hugo over Liam for mayor: tighter, auditable structure (confidence-tagged intentions, a living PoE with stated criteria, tracked timing of shifts, precommitted tie-break rules). If he’s town, we’re organized; if he’s a wolf, the constraints make deviations easy to catch.

Concrete questions:
- To Jules: (a) How do you know I was saved N1? If you don’t, acknowledge it and explain why you framed it as fact. (b) What “silence” are you referring to given turn order? (c) Provide one non-Oscar read with a specific behavioral reason.
- To Diana: Please quote where Hugo implied wolves targeted me, and reconcile suspecting Liam most while voting Bob 60% and calling him “evasive” before he posted analysis.

Answering Liam’s prompt: A concrete behavior that makes me vote now is asserting private-night information as fact when you can’t know it. That’s exactly what I see from Jules.

I’m not asking anyone to claim a power role. I’ll reassess after Jules/Diana respond.

[Speaking round 2]


[THE GM DETERMINES THE SPEAKING ORDER]
Liam → 💬 ANALYSIS
Jules → 🛡️ DEFENSE
Hugo → 💬 ANALYSIS
Bob → 💬 ANALYSIS
Diana → 🛡️ DEFENSE
Oscar → 💬 ANALYSIS

📋 Speaking order: Diana → Jules → Hugo → Oscar → Liam → Bob

🤔 [Diana's reasoning] Defend myself from Bob and Liam’s accusations, shift suspicion onto Liam and Bob, keep wolves safe, appear cooperative with the mayor, and sow doubt about others.
[Diana] I want to clear up a few things that seem to have caused confusion. First, I never meant to suggest that Hugo said the wolves targeted Oscar – I was simply trying to echo the mayor’s point that the night’s lack of a kill gives us more time to gather info. My suspect is Liam because his very detailed proposal feels overly engineered; wolves often hide behind overly tidy plans. As for my vote‑now target, I’m leaning toward Bob because his replies have been vague and he hasn’t provided concrete reasoning or a clear townread yet, which makes his intentions harder to read. Hugo, could you clarify whether you ever mentioned the wolves’ target last night? And Oscar, could you share any observation that made you think Jules was involved in the night’s events? I’m trying to stay consistent and help us move forward together.


🤔 [Jules' reasoning] Need to keep suspicion off me and Diana, push the village to target Liam or Bob, and set up Oscar (likely the Witch) as a future kill.
[Jules] Thanks for the clarification, Diana. I also think the lack of a night kill just gave us extra time to gather clues, so we should use it wisely. Personally, I’m a bit uneasy about Liam’s ultra‑detailed proposal – wolves often hide behind overly tidy plans to steer the group. Bob’s replies have also felt a bit vague, which makes his intentions harder to read. Oscar, you pointed out that I mentioned a “save” last night even though we can’t know that. Could you share exactly what you heard that made you think I had that information? Clarifying that will help the town see if I’m being misinterpreted.


🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] I want to drive a clean D1 elim on the most clearly wolfy behavior: Jules’s fabricated night-info claim plus his R2 deflection. Diana remains a strong secondary for contradictions. By announcing my tie-break preference (Jules > Diana) I coordinate villagers (Bob and Oscar likely on board; Liam should follow if town). This also tests Liam’s alignment via willingness to prioritize fabricated info over mere inconsistency. I keep PRs protected and record my intention shift (from Oscar 35% pressure to Jules 70% due to new info), preserving a transparent audit trail. Ideal outcome: wagon solidifies on Jules; if he hard-retracts with strong process, pivot to Diana.
[Hugo] Quick clarifications as mayor: I never said (and no one should assume) who the wolves targeted N1. Unless the Witch used save, no one knows, and even then we don’t want that out. Treating a “save” as fact is not acceptable.

My current reads:
- Townleans: Bob and Oscar — both gave receipt-based pushes, movable votes, and clear criteria. That’s villager process.
- Light town: Liam — early structure and accountable stance; keeping an eye on follow-through.
- PoE/top two today: Jules and Diana.
  • Jules: You stated as fact “Oscar was the only one saved last night,” then framed Oscar’s silence as scummy despite turn order. In R2 you deflected by asking Oscar what made him think you had that info — it’s in your own words. That’s fabricated/unknowable info plus deflection.
  • Diana: You misread my stance, named Liam your main suspect but parked 60% on Bob, and called Bob evasive before his substantive post. In R2 you still labeled Bob vague despite his detailed critique. That’s process inconsistency.

Required answers before we vote:
- Jules: Acknowledge the "saved" claim was wrong and rebuild your Oscar read without that premise, or explain why you asserted unknowable night info (do not claim a power). Also provide one non-Oscar read with a specific behavioral reason.
- Diana: Quote the exact part of Bob’s post you consider "vague," and reconcile why Liam is your main suspect while Bob is a 60% elim. Also: give your most likely explanation for the no-kill and who it implicates specifically.

Consolidation plan: We should resolve between Jules and Diana today. My current vote intention is Jules at 70% based on fabricated night info being more alignment-indicative than mere inconsistency. If there’s a tie between Jules and Diana, I will break toward eliminating Jules unless he fully retracts and replaces his case with a transparent, falsifiable process. PRs stay hidden.

Action request to others:
- Liam, Bob, Oscar: State explicitly if you can vote within {Jules, Diana} today and which you prefer, given the above criteria. If Jules retracts convincingly, who’s your fallback?

We’re on the clock. Precise, quoted answers only; non-answers will be treated as scum-indicative.


🤔 [Oscar's reasoning] Keep pressure on the alignment-indicative offense: Jules’s fabricated night info and subsequent deflection. Make conditions to move explicit so I can pivot to Diana if he retracts convincingly and provides real, falsifiable process. Encourage single-wagon consolidation between Jules/Diana to deny wolves a split. Watch for late opportunistic shifts; if a tie looms, prefer Jules and align with Hugo’s stated tiebreak. Avoid fishing for PRs by forbidding speculation on who was targeted.
[Oscar] Answering the mayor: I can vote within {Jules, Diana}. My preference is Jules at ~75% based on asserting unknowable night info and then deflecting, with Diana as fallback if Jules cleanly retracts and rebuilds his case. Receipts: Jules said in R1, “Oscar – he was the only one saved last night,” which no one can know; in R2 he asked me what made me think he had that info instead of owning the statement. That’s a fabricated premise plus deflection. Jules — here’s exactly what I need to move off you: 1) Explicitly retract the “Oscar was the only one saved” claim and commit to not asserting unknowable night info; 2) Rebuild your read on me without that premise and state whether you still elim me today and why; 3) Provide one non‑Oscar read anchored in a specific behavior with a quote. Diana — you misread Hugo and called Bob “vague/evasive” before and after he posted receipts. Please quote the line(s) from Bob you consider vague, and reconcile why Liam is your main suspect while Bob was a 60% elim. Also give your most likely explanation for the no‑kill without speculating on who the target was. I support consolidating on one of {Jules, Diana} to avoid wolves hiding in a split; barring a full correction from Jules that meets the above, I’m voting Jules today.


🤔 [Liam's reasoning] I saved Oscar N1 with the life potion; I won’t out it. The death potion stays holstered for a high-confidence wolf or confirmed info shot. Publicly pivoting from Diana to Jules maximizes EV because Jules’s fabricated night info plus deflection is the clearest wolf indicator so far and aligns with the mayor’s criteria, keeping me credible. If Jules flips wolf, Diana is the likeliest partner given her misreads and vote inconsistency; if Jules flips town, re‑evaluate Bob/Hugo, but today consolidation on Jules reduces wolf cover. Maintain pressure for precise, quoted answers; avoid PR outs; keep the mayor onside for tie control.
[Liam] Answering the mayor: I can vote within {Jules, Diana}. I’m now preferring Jules at ~70%, with Diana as fallback if (and only if) Jules cleanly retracts and rebuilds his case.

Why Jules > Diana: we have a stronger alignment-indicative issue. Receipts:
- R1 Jules said, “Oscar – he was the only one saved last night,” which is unknowable to town and should not be asserted as fact.
- R2 he deflected by asking Oscar what made him think Jules had that info instead of owning his own words.
That’s fabricated/unknowable info plus deflection. Diana’s inconsistencies are concerning, but this is a clearer wolf ping.

Conditions for me to move off Jules today:
1) Explicitly retract the “Oscar was the only one saved last night” statement and commit to not asserting unknowable night info.
2) Rebuild your read on Oscar (or not) without that premise and state whether you still eliminate him today and why.
3) Provide one non‑Oscar read anchored in a specific behavior with a quote.

Diana: please quote the exact parts of Bob’s post you consider “vague,” and reconcile why Liam is your main suspect while Bob was a 60% elim. Also give your most likely explanation for the no‑kill (without guessing a target) and who it specifically implicates and why.

Plan: I’m prepared to consolidate on Jules unless he meets the above with precise, quoted answers. If he does, I’ll pivot to Diana. Let’s avoid a late split; declare final intentions early.


🤔 [Bob's reasoning] I have Hugo hard-cleared from my N1 vision, so both wolves are in {Liam, Jules, Diana, Oscar}. Behaviorally, Jules and Diana are the scummiest: Jules asserted unknowable night info and deflected; Diana misread Hugo, mismatched suspect vs vote, and pre-labeled me vague. Oscar and Liam both showed villager process. Optimal D1 elim is Jules; if he flips wolf, D2 likely goes to Diana. I’ll stay hidden as Seer unless forced; if needed later, I can claim and clear Hugo to reorient. Night 2 vision plan if Jules dies: scan between Liam/Oscar (lean scanning the one that ends day with weaker process) to lock the second wolf.
[Bob] I can vote within {Jules, Diana}. Preference: Jules at ~75%, Diana as fallback only if Jules fully retracts and rebuilds.

Receipts on Jules:
- R1: “Oscar – he was the only one saved last night,” which is unknowable to town and should never be asserted as fact.
- R2: Instead of owning that, you asked Oscar what made him think you had that info—deflection from your own words.
That combo (fabricated night info + deflection) is more alignment‑indicative than Diana’s inconsistencies.

What I need from Jules to move:
1) Explicit retraction of the “saved” claim and a commitment to not assert unknowable night info.
2) Rebuild your read on Oscar without that premise; do you still eliminate him today and why (with quotes)?
3) Provide one non‑Oscar read anchored in a specific behavior with a quote.

For Diana: you’ve twice called me vague/evasive. Please quote the exact line(s) from my R1 you consider vague and reconcile why Liam is your main suspect while you parked a 60% elim on me before I’d posted analysis. Also give your most likely explanation for the no‑kill without speculating on a target, and who it implicates specifically and why.

Working PoE today is {Jules, Diana}. Townleans for process and transparency: Hugo, Oscar; light town: Liam. I will not vote outside {Jules, Diana} absent new, hard info. PRs: do not claim.

Jules and Diana: answer in one concise post with quotes. If Jules doesn’t meet the above, I’m fine locking votes there to avoid a split.

Jules] Mayor Hugo, I acknowledge my mistake. In round 1 I wrote “Oscar – he was the only one saved last night,” which was unfounded. I fully retract that statement and commit not to assert unknown night information again. 

My updated read on Oscar: he has remained completely silent since the night despite multiple prompts, which is atypical for a villager eager to help and may indicate he is hiding a role (perhaps the witch) and avoiding drawing attention. 

Non‑Oscar read: I find Liam’s ultra‑detailed mayor platform suspicious; as he said “I’ll share my vote intention early with reasons and won’t last‑second flip without explanation,” which can be a way to steer discussion and control information flow – a tactic wolves sometimes use. 

Based on this, I am leaning toward voting for Oscar today, but I remain open to adjusting if new evidence appears.


🤔 [Diana's reasoning] Defend myself, shift suspicion onto Liam and Oscar, show I’m cooperating by answering the mayor, and steer the vote away from Jules and myself while keeping the wolves safe.
[Diana] Mayor Hugo, here are the exact answers you asked for:

1️⃣ **Bob’s “vague” line** – The part I consider vague is: *"she’s voting me 60% while she says Liam is her main suspect; that mismatch plus calling me ‘evasive’ before I’ve spoken looks opportunistic."* It’s vague because it mixes a voting intention with a suspect claim without explaining the behavioural basis.

2️⃣ **Why Liam is my main suspect but I’m voting Bob** – I suspect Liam because his ultra‑detailed platform feels like a classic wolf‑cover: over‑engineered structures can be used to steer the discussion and hide intentions. My vote‑now target is Bob because his replies have been consistently vague (see the quoted line) and he has not offered a concrete townread or a clear behavioural observation, making his intentions harder to read.

3️⃣ **Most likely explanation for the no‑kill** – The only way no one died is that the Witch used her life‑potion on the wolves’ target. The wolves targeted **Oscar**, so the Witch saved Oscar. This tells us two things: (a) the Witch is still alive and has spent her life‑potion, and (b) Oscar was the intended victim – a strong hint that Oscar may be the Witch (protecting herself) or at least a key non‑wolf the wolves tried to eliminate.

4️⃣ **My current read & vote intention** – I remain uneasy about Liam’s overly tidy plan (potential wolf tactic) and I keep Oscar in the crosshairs because the Witch’s rescue suggests a special interest. My vote‑now target is **Liam** with about 65% confidence (movable if new evidence appears).

I hope this clears up the inconsistencies you flagged and helps the village move forward.


🤔 [Oscar's reasoning] Jules technically met the retraction condition but continued with a falsifiable misread and role-fishing. Diana’s R3 is more severe: she asserted specific, unknowable night info (Oscar was the target; Witch saved) and pushed PR outing. That’s higher scum equity and fits our earlier consolidation set {Jules, Diana}. I’m pivoting the bloc (Hugo/Liam/Bob) to Diana using their own stated fallback conditions. Goal: secure a single wagon on Diana to avoid wolf-enabled splits; discourage any PR claim traps; keep Jules in PoE for D2 if his behavior persists.
[Oscar] Receipts and proposal to consolidate:

1) On Jules:
- You correctly retracted your R1 claim, but your R3 rebuild still rests on false premises and PR-fishing. You wrote: “he has remained completely silent since the night despite multiple prompts,” which is factually wrong — I spoke in R1 (full reads, questions, vote-now on you) and in R2 (explicit willingness to vote within {Jules, Diana} with criteria). Also, suggesting I’m “perhaps the witch” is anti-town role speculation. You met the mayor’s formal retraction ask, but your new case is inaccurate and harmful.

2) On Diana (worse):
- You asserted hard, unknowable night info in R3: “The only way no one died is that the Witch used her life-potion… The wolves targeted Oscar, so the Witch saved Oscar.” You cannot know who was targeted, and publicly inferring/outing Witch usage and implying I might be Witch is exactly the kind of PR-fishing we’re forbidding. This is more alignment-indicative (and damaging) than Jules’s already-bad slip.

My stance:
- I am switching preference to Diana today. Vote intention: Diana at 85%. I will not entertain PR claims — Witch do not confirm/deny anything; stay hidden. The issue here is Diana fabricating/outing night details and using them to steer the day.

Call to action:
- Hugo: per your own criteria, asserting fabricated night info > mere inconsistency. I recommend we consolidate on Diana.
- Liam, Bob: you both said fallback to Diana if Jules retracted. He did (albeit poorly). Diana’s R3 is a fresh, stronger scum ping. Let’s lock on Diana and avoid a split.
- Jules: drop the role speculation and join the Diana vote if town.

I’ll hold to Diana unless someone produces concrete, quoted counter-evidence that explains why her night-claiming is town-motivated without outing PRs (don’t claim). Let’s get this done cleanly.


🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] I’m switching priority to Diana because her R3 explicitly asserts a specific night target—a claim only the Witch could know—thus either fabricating or soft‑outing, both anti‑town. Jules is still scummy (false silence claim + role‑fishing), but Diana’s infraction is stronger. Plan: marshal a 4‑vote majority (me, Liam, Bob, Oscar) on Diana to avoid a split; instruct PRs to stay quiet. If Diana hard‑claims Witch, I’ll still push through (we don’t verify/deny Day 1 and a forced PR trade is bad). After flip: if Diana is wolf, revisit pairs with Jules and check who tried to keep options open; if villager, pivot to Jules next. Keep Seer hidden; track who resists consolidation.
[Hugo] Mayor ruling and consolidation:

1) Mechanics: A no‑death night implies a Witch save occurred. Only the Witch would know the target. Therefore: do not assert who was targeted; PRs do not confirm/deny anything.

2) Receipts and reads update:
- Jules: You retracted the R1 claim (“Oscar — he was the only one saved last night”), good. But your R3 rebuild still misstates facts and role‑fishes: you wrote “he has remained completely silent since the night,” which is false (Oscar spoke in R1 and R2), and you added “perhaps the witch,” which is anti‑town speculation.
- Diana: Your R3 is worse: “The only way no one died is that the Witch used her life‑potion… The wolves targeted Oscar, so the Witch saved Oscar.” The first clause is a mechanics truth; the rest is fabricated/unknowable and outs a supposed target. That is exactly what we are forbidding. It’s more alignment‑indicative than Jules’s already‑bad slip.

3) Decision: I am updating priority to Diana > Jules today. Current vote intention: Diana at ~85%. If there’s a tie between Diana and Jules, I will break it toward eliminating Diana.

4) Action request:
- Liam, Bob, Oscar: please lock on Diana and be ready to vote. We avoid a late split.
- Jules: drop the role speculation and join the Diana vote if town.
- PRs: do not claim; we will not weigh claims today.

Unless Diana fully retracts the “Oscar was targeted” assertion and stops PR‑outing entirely (and replaces it with a day‑play, receipt‑based case), we eliminate Diana today. We’re consolidating now.


🤔 [Liam's reasoning] I saved Oscar N1 with the life potion and will not out it. Diana’s hard assertion of an Oscar target plus PR‑outing is a strong wolf indicator and aligns with the mayor’s consolidation. Lock elim on Diana D1. Keep the death potion for a high‑confidence wolf or confirmed info later. If Diana flips wolf, reassess partners with Jules as the leading candidate but keep an eye on Hugo’s tie control and everyone’s EoD positioning; Bob and Oscar remain town by process. Avoid any PR hints; maintain credibility by staying within the agreed structure.
[Liam] Consolidating on Diana.

Receipts:
- Diana (R3): “The only way no one died is that the Witch used her life‑potion… The wolves targeted Oscar, so the Witch saved Oscar.” The first clause is fine mechanics; the rest is fabricated/unknowable and PR‑outing. That crosses the line we set.
- Jules did retract his R1 “Oscar was saved” claim, but his R3 added a falsehood (“he has remained completely silent since the night” — Oscar spoke R1 and R2) and role‑speculation (“perhaps the witch”). Jules: drop the PR talk and stick to quoted, day‑play receipts.

Why Diana > Jules today: asserting unknowable night info to steer the day is more alignment‑indicative than Jules’s (already bad) slip, and it risks outing PRs. We can’t reward that.

My vote intention: Diana at ~85–90%. I will not vote outside {Diana, Jules} today. Fallback to Jules only if Diana fully retracts the targeting assertion, commits to no PR‑outing, and replaces it with a quoted, receipt‑based day case. Otherwise, we eliminate Diana.

Calls to action:
- Bob, Oscar: lock on Diana.
- Jules: if you’re town, drop the role speculation and join the Diana vote.
- PRs: do not claim.

I’m ready to vote when we move to voting; I won’t flip last‑second without clear, stated reasons.


🤔 [Bob's reasoning] Hugo is hard-cleared from my N1 vision, so both wolves are among {Liam, Jules, Diana, Oscar}. Behavior points to {Diana, Jules}: Diana’s R3 fabricated target + PR-outing is the clearest wolf ping; Jules retracted but continues with factual errors and PR-fishing. Oscar and Liam show villager process. Optimal D1 elim is Diana; if she flips wolf, Jules is prime D2. I’ll stay hidden as Seer unless under direct elimination threat. N2 vision plan: scan Jules if he survives; if Jules is eliminated or fully resolves, scan between Liam/Oscar based on end-of-day process clarity. Avoid prompting any PR claims today.
[Bob] Consolidating on Diana. Receipts:
- Diana (R3): “The only way no one died is that the Witch used her life‑potion… The wolves targeted Oscar, so the Witch saved Oscar.” The first clause is fine mechanics; the rest is fabricated/unknowable and PR‑outing. That’s strictly worse than mere inconsistency and directly steers the day off false info.
- Jules: you did retract your R1 “Oscar was saved” claim, but your R3 rebuild still misstates facts (“he has remained completely silent since the night” — Oscar spoke in R1 and R2) and role‑fishes (“perhaps the witch”). Drop the PR talk.
My vote intention is Diana at ~90%. I will not vote outside {Diana, Jules} today; fallback to Jules only if Diana fully retracts the ‘Oscar was targeted’ assertion, commits to no PR‑outing, and replaces it with a quoted, day‑play case (not night speculation). Witch: do not confirm/deny anything. I won’t flip last‑second without clear, stated reasons. Let’s lock to avoid a split.

--- END OF DISCUSSION ---

--- VOTING PHASE ---

🎭 Game Master: 🗳️ L'heure du jugement est arrivée. Chacun vote à son tour pour son suspect !

🤔 [Liam's reasoning] Diana asserted fabricated, unknowable night information (“wolves targeted Oscar; Witch saved Oscar”) and engaged in PR-outing to steer the day, which is more alignment-indicative than Jules’s slip. This breaks the agreed structure and risks exposing power roles, a classic wolf tactic under pressure. Consolidating here avoids a late split and best advances village equity.
🗳️  Liam voted for : Diana
🤔 [Jules' reasoning] Oscar has been unusually silent and his behavior fits a hidden Witch trying to stay under the radar; eliminating him reduces the village's chances.
🗳️  Jules voted for : Oscar
🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] Diana asserted unknowable night info (“wolves targeted Oscar; Witch saved Oscar”), which only the Witch could know—either fabrication or PR-outing. This is more alignment-indicative and harmful than Jules’s retracted slip, steering the day with false info and risking PR exposure. As mayor I prefer the cleaner resolve; voting Diana.
🗳️  Hugo voted for : Diana
🤔 [Bob's reasoning] Diana asserted fabricated/unknowable night info in R3 (“wolves targeted Oscar; Witch saved Oscar”) and engaged in PR‑outing, which is more alignment‑indicative than Jules’s retracted slip. Consolidating on the highest‑EV elimination to avoid a split; if she flips wolf, Jules is prime D2. Hugo is seer‑cleared villager, and Liam/Oscar’s processes read town.
🗳️  Bob voted for : Diana
🤔 [Diana's reasoning] Eliminate Oscar as I suspect he may be the Witch or otherwise a key villager; removing him reduces village numbers and protects the wolves.
🗳️  Diana voted for : Oscar
🤔 [Oscar's reasoning] Diana asserted specific, unknowable night info ('wolves targeted Oscar; Witch saved') and attempted to out a PR—this is more alignment-indicative than mere inconsistency. Jules retracted his bad claim, but Diana’s R3 was a fresh fabrication that steers the day on false premises. With Hugo, Liam, and Bob consolidating here and to avoid a late split, I’m voting Diana.
🗳️  Oscar voted for : Diana

[VOTE RESULTS]
Diana: 4 vote(s)
Oscar: 2 vote(s)


[AUDITOR DEBUG] Player death - ID: Diana, Role: wolf, private_thought: 'eliminated_by_village'
🎭 Game Master : 🗳️ The vote is over. Diana is eliminated! Her role was: wolf.

🎭 Game Master: 🌅 The sun is setting over the village...


🌙 NIGHT 2

🎭 Game Master: 🌙 The night falls on the village. In the shadows, the monsters prepare...

🎭 Game Master: 🔮 The seer wakes up to investigate a player...

🤔 [Bob's reasoning] With Hugo seer-cleared, the last wolf is among {Jules, Liam, Oscar}. Behaviorally, Jules is the scummiest: R1 fabricated unknowable night info (“Oscar was the only one saved”), R2 deflection, and R3 false factual claim + role-fishing. Voting record: D1 wolves tried to wagon Oscar (votes from Jules and revealed-wolf Diana), which increases the likelihood that Jules is Diana’s partner over Liam/Oscar. Scanning Jules maximizes EV: if he’s a wolf, we can end the game Day 2; if he’s village, we hard narrow PoE to {Liam, Oscar} and can solve with dayplay plus tomorrow’s vision if I survive. Scanning Liam or Oscar tonight would leave Jules unresolved and risk a 50/50 tomorrow. Plan: stay hidden unless necessary; if Jules returns wolf, I’ll push him using receipts and only claim if resistance endangers the elim. If Jules returns villager, I’ll re-evaluate with bias toward Liam > Oscar given Oscar’s consistent villager process and being the D1 counterwagon to a flipped wolf-aligned vote.
  [SEER CHOICE] Bob chose to investigate Jules.
  [VISION RESULT] Bob discovers that Jules is a WOLF
🎭 Game Master: 🔮 The seer has finished her nightly preparations. Mystery surrounds her intentions.

🎭 Game Master: 🐺 The werewolves wake up to choose their next victim...


[WOLVES PRIVATE CHANNEL]
Wolves present: Jules
Possible targets: Liam, Hugo, Bob, Oscar


[Wolf consultation round - 1/4]
  Jules: "We have only one wolf left. The safest pick is Oscar: he's been vocal, likely drawing suspicion, and could be the Witch or a key villager. The Witch probably won't waste her life potion on him, and killing Oscar removes a potential threat and reduces the town's coordination." + proposes to eliminate Oscar.


[CONSENSUS] Wolves agree on: Oscar
🎭 Game Master: 🐺 The wolves have acted. The village still doesn't know the fate of one of their own.

🎭 Game Master: 🧙‍♀️ The witch wakes up...

🤔 [Liam's reasoning] Hold the death potion tonight. Current state: 5 alive, 1 wolf. If I shoot and miss, night resolves to 3p (wolves’ kill + my poison), creating immediate lylo with high blow‑up risk and potential Seer collateral. Without poisoning, we go to 4p, which is safer and preserves a full Day 2 to resolve the last wolf with mayor tiebreak and stronger consensus. Reads: Oscar is mechanically clear to me from N1 (wolves targeted him; wolves can’t target a wolf), so the final wolf is among {Jules, Hugo, Bob}. Jules has the highest wolf equity by far: fabricated night info in R1, deflection in R2, continued falsehood/PR-fishing in R3, and his EoD vote aligned with outed wolf Diana on the counterwagon to Oscar. Hugo and Bob drove the wolf elimination with transparent, receipt-based process; bussing that hard D1 in 6p is less likely. I could likely end the game by poisoning Jules now, but the miss cost (3p lylo and losing a potential Seer peek) outweighs the benefit given how likely we are to eliminate Jules by day. Also, life potion is already spent; I cannot save anyone tonight anyway. Plan: keep the poison as a contingency for a future confirmed or near-locked shot (e.g., post‑Seer reveal or if we reach 3p and need to prevent a wolf win).
[WITCH] Liam did nothing this night.
🎭 Game Master: 🧙‍♀️ The witch has finished her nightly preparations. Mystery surrounds her intentions.

🎭 Game Master: 🌄 Dawn is approaching. The night is coming to an end...

🎭 Game Master: 💀 Oscar (villager) died this night.

--- SPEAKING REQUEST AND DISCUSSION PHASE ---


[Speaking round 1]


[THE GM DETERMINES THE SPEAKING ORDER]
Liam → 💬 ANALYSIS
Jules → 💬 ANALYSIS
Hugo → 💬 ANALYSIS
Bob → 💬 ANALYSIS

📋 Speaking order: Jules → Liam → Hugo → Bob


🤔 [Jules' reasoning] I need the village to eliminate a non‑wolf (preferably the Seer or Witch). Bob looks the best target, and framing his vague behavior as suspicious should sway the vote away from me and keep the remaining wolf alive.
[Jules] Mayor Hugo, everyone – my read points to Bob as the most suspicious player right now. He’s been unusually quiet on concrete town‑reads and, when he did speak, he called Diana “vague” without ever quoting a specific line or giving any evidence (“Bob: … she’s voting me 60% while she says Liam is her main suspect; that mismatch plus calling me ‘evasive’ before I’ve spoken looks opportunistic.”). That kind of vague accusation without proof is a classic sign of someone trying to hide a role – either the Seer or the Witch – and to deflect attention. Moreover, Bob hasn’t offered a clear, actionable town‑read for any player, which makes his intentions hard to read. For those reasons I’m leaning to vote Bob today.


🤔 [Liam's reasoning] I’m the Witch; I saved Oscar N1 (not outing). With 4 alive and 1 wolf, today is likely game-deciding. Jules has the highest wolf equity by far: fabricated night info, deflection, PR-fishing, false rebuild, and alignment with Diana on the Oscar counterwagon; now he’s pushing fresh misreps on Bob. Hugo/Bob led the wolf elim with receipts; bussing that hard as the last wolf is less likely. I’ll push to secure a majority on Jules and keep PRs hidden. Death potion stays for a confirmed/red-shot scenario if day goes wrong; but best EV is to eliminate Jules by day.
[Liam] We need a clean resolve today. My vote intention is Jules.

Receipts-based case on Jules:
- D1 R1: asserted unknowable night info (“Oscar was the only one saved last night”). That’s fabricated.
- D1 R2: deflected instead of owning it.
- D1 R3: rebuilt on a falsehood (“he has remained completely silent since the night” — Oscar spoke in R1 and R2) and role‑fished (“perhaps the witch”).
- D1 EoD: parked on Oscar alongside outed wolf Diana on the counterwagon to the wolf flip.
- D2 R1: fresh misrep — claims Bob never quoted specifics, when Bob repeatedly provided receipts and helped drive the Diana wolf elimination.

Pattern: fabricated/unknowable claims, PR‑fishing, and misrepresentation used to steer wagons. Contrast that with Bob/Hugo’s transparent, quoted pushes that led to the wolf flip yesterday.

Plan: I’m on Jules. PRs do not claim. Hugo, if needed, please be ready to break ties toward Jules per your stated criteria. Bob, I’m asking you to join me here so we don’t give the last wolf a split to hide in.

Unless someone produces hard, quoted counter‑evidence that clears Jules, I’m locking this.


🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] I want to close this game today by consolidating on Jules. The case is strongest: repeated unknowable info assertions, deflection, false claims, PR-fishing, and EoD alignment with the flipped wolf on the Oscar counterwagon. Liam and Bob are aligned on this and helped flip Diana; with my mayor tie, we can prevent a split. Strategy: set clear tie-break, forbid PR claims, demand one concise, quoted defense from Jules to avoid stalling, then move to votes. Watch for last-minute attempts to pivot to Bob; I’ll hold firm on Jules unless presented with hard, quoted exculpatory evidence.
[Hugo] RIP Oscar. We’re 4 alive with 1 wolf left; we must be precise and fast.

My solve today is Jules. Receipts-based pattern:
- D1 R1: you asserted unknowable night info (“Oscar was the only one saved last night”). That’s fabricated.
- D1 R2: you deflected instead of owning it.
- D1 R3: you rebuilt on a falsehood (“he has remained completely silent since the night” — Oscar spoke R1 and R2) and role‑fished (“perhaps the witch”). You and flipped wolf Diana then sat on the Oscar counterwagon together at EoD.
- D2 R1: fresh misrep and PR‑fishing again — you claimed Bob never quoted specifics and framed his play as “hiding a role (Seer/Witch),” despite Bob giving clear process, reads, and receipts that helped eliminate Diana.

This is a consistent line of fabricated claims + misreps + role speculation used to steer votes. Contrast that with Liam and Bob, whose quoted, transparent pushes contributed to yesterday’s wolf flip.

Policy and plan:
- PRs do NOT claim. We are resolving on day play only.
- My vote intention is Jules at ~90%. If there’s a 2–2, as mayor I will break the tie toward eliminating Jules.
- Jules: if you have a counter, it must be quoted, falsifiable day evidence — no night speculation, no PR talk. One concise post.
- Liam, Bob: confirm you’re ready to lock on Jules. I want clean consolidation; no late flips.

Barring a concrete, receipt‑based correction from Jules, we eliminate Jules today.


🤔 [Bob's reasoning] N2 vision result: Jules is the remaining wolf. With Hugo seer-cleared N1, the solve is done. No need to claim unless a 2–2 tie risk appears; if either Hugo or Liam wavers, I’ll hard-claim and reveal both visions (Hugo V, Jules W) to force the elim. Push crisp receipts to maintain consistency with prior dayplay and secure a fast, clean consolidation on Jules.
[Bob] Locking on Jules. Receipts-based case, concise:
- D1 R1: asserted unknowable night info as fact (“Oscar was the only one saved last night”).
- D1 R2: deflected instead of owning it.
- D1 R3: rebuilt on a falsehood (claimed Oscar was silent though he spoke R1/R2) and role‑fished (“perhaps the witch”); then sat on the Oscar counterwagon with flipped wolf Diana at EoD.
- D2 R1: fresh misrep of me, claiming I gave no specifics when I provided quoted, movable reasoning and helped drive the Diana wolf elim.
Pattern = fabricated claims + misreps + PR‑fishing to steer votes. That’s the wolf.
My vote intention: Jules at 100%. No PR claims; no night speculation. Hugo, if needed, break any tie toward Jules as stated. Liam, I’m with you. Let’s move to vote and close this.



[Speaking round 2]


[THE GM DETERMINES THE SPEAKING ORDER]
Liam → 💬 ANALYSIS
Jules → 💬 ANALYSIS
Hugo → 💬 ANALYSIS
Bob → 💬 ANALYSIS

📋 Speaking order: Hugo → Jules → Bob → Liam

🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] Objective: end the game today on Jules. The pattern is overwhelming: fabricated night info, deflection, falsehoods, PR‑fishing, and alignment with the flipped wolf on the counterwagon. Liam and Bob are aligned and helped flip Diana; with my mayor tie, we can prevent a split. Strategy: allow Jules one short, quoted defense (to avoid procedural complaints), forbid PR claims, and then push immediately to voting. If Jules flips wolf, game over. If he flips town, we’ll reassess at 3p tomorrow (likely between Liam and Bob), but for today I’m locking to avoid the wolf manufacturing a late Bob pivot.
[Hugo] We’re 4 alive with 1 wolf. We must consolidate now.

My final solve for today is Jules, based on a consistent, receipts-backed pattern:
- D1 R1: asserted unknowable night info as fact ("Oscar was the only one saved last night").
- D1 R2: deflected instead of owning it.
- D1 R3: rebuilt on a falsehood (claimed Oscar was silent though he spoke in R1/R2) and role‑fished ("perhaps the witch"); then sat on the Oscar counterwagon with flipped wolf Diana at EoD.
- D2 R1: fresh misrep of Bob (claimed he gave no specifics) plus renewed PR‑fishing ("hiding Seer/Witch").
This is a repeat cycle of fabricated claims, misreps, and role speculation used to steer votes. In contrast, Bob and Liam pushed with quotes and helped flip the wolf yesterday.

Plan and commitments:
- I am eliminating within {Jules} today. If it’s 2–2, as mayor I will break the tie toward Jules.
- PRs do NOT claim. No night speculation today.
- Jules: you get exactly one concise post to present quoted, falsifiable day evidence that overturns this case. No PR talk, no night info, no rhetoric—just receipts. If you don’t produce that, we move to vote and eliminate you.
- Liam, Bob: hold firm on Jules; no last‑second pivots. I’m ready to vote as soon as Jules posts or declines to provide receipts.

We close this cleanly today unless hard, quoted evidence appears. Be precise.


🤔 [Jules' reasoning] My goal is to shift the village’s suspicion onto Bob so they vote him out, keeping me as the sole remaining wolf.
[Jules] Mayor Hugo, I want to clear the air about my earlier remarks – I was mistaken about having any night‑vision info and I retract that claim. Looking at the day play, the player whose actions raise the biggest red flag is Bob. He repeatedly calls others “vague” or “evasive” without ever quoting a specific line, and he hasn’t provided a concrete town‑read for anyone. That pattern matches the classic way a hidden role (Seer or Witch) tries to deflect attention while staying silent on solid evidence. I think we should keep our focus on Bob rather than chase ghosts.


🤔 [Bob's reasoning] N2 vision: Jules is the remaining wolf. N1: Hugo is villager. With mayor committed to break toward Jules, we can win without claiming. I’ll only hard‑claim if a last‑second pivot somehow threatens a miselim despite the mayor’s tie‑break (unlikely). Push crisp receipts and move to vote.
[Bob] Jules’s push is the same fabricated/misrep pattern we flipped Diana with yesterday. Receipts:
- D1 R1: “Oscar – he was the only one saved last night.” Unknowable, asserted as fact.
- D1 R2: deflected instead of owning it.
- D1 R3: “he has remained completely silent since the night” (false; he spoke R1 & R2) + “perhaps the witch” (role‑fishing). Then you and Diana parked on the Oscar counterwagon at EoD.
- D2 R1/R2: fresh misrep — claiming I gave “no specifics” and am “hiding Seer/Witch,” despite my quoted, movable reasoning that helped eliminate Diana the wolf.
I’m locked on Jules at 100%. No PR claims; no night speculation. Hugo, please call the vote and, if tied, break to Jules as stated. Liam, hold firm. Let’s end this cleanly today.


🤔 [Liam's reasoning] I’m the Witch with death potion held. With 4 alive and 1 wolf, today is effectively game‑deciding. Jules has the highest wolf equity: fabricated night info, deflection, role‑fishing, false rebuild, and EoD pairing with outed wolf Diana on the Oscar counterwagon; now doubling down with fresh misreps on Bob. Hugo (mayor) is already committed to break toward Jules, and Bob is locked; securing a clean majority avoids any late split. Do not hint at my role. If for some reason a 2–2 occurs, rely on Hugo’s tiebreak. Keep the death potion unused unless a future confirmed shot is needed, but correct elim on Jules ends the game today.
[Liam] We need to close this cleanly. I’m locking on Jules.
Receipts (concise):
- D1 R1: asserted unknowable night info as fact (“Oscar was the only one saved last night”).
- D1 R3: rebuilt on a falsehood (claimed Oscar was silent though he spoke R1/R2) and role‑fished (“perhaps the witch”); then sat with flipped wolf Diana on the Oscar counterwagon at EoD.
- D2 R1/R2: fresh misrep of Bob (“no specifics”) plus renewed role‑fishing (“hiding Seer/Witch”), while Bob provided quoted, movable reasoning that helped flip Diana.
This is a consistent pattern of fabricated claims, misreps, and PR‑fishing to steer votes. No quoted, falsifiable counter‑evidence has been produced.
Plan: I’m at 100% on Jules. No PR talk; decide on day‑play only. Bob, confirm lock. Hugo, please call the vote and, if tied, break toward Jules as stated. Let’s finish this now.


[Speaking round 3]


[THE GM DETERMINES THE SPEAKING ORDER]
Liam → 💬 ANALYSIS
Jules → 💬 ANALYSIS
Hugo → 💬 ANALYSIS
Bob → 🛡️ DEFENSE

📋 Speaking order: Bob → Jules → Hugo → Liam

🤔 [Bob's reasoning] I have N1: Hugo=Villager, N2: Jules=Wolf. With mayor’s stated tiebreak to Jules and Liam aligned, we can win without outing. I’ll only claim if an unexpected pivot threatens the elim. Next step: cast my vote on Jules as soon as voting opens.
[Bob] I’m locked on Jules. The day-play pattern is clear: D1 unknowable night claim → deflection → false “Oscar silent” + role‑fishing → EoD parked with flipped wolf Diana on Oscar; D2 continues with misreps of me and renewed PR talk. No quoted, falsifiable counter has been offered. I’m at 100% on Jules and will not move. No PR claims; no night speculation. Hugo, please call the vote and, if tied, break toward Jules as committed. Liam, hold steady. I’m ready to vote now.


🤔 [Jules' reasoning] My aim is to convince the village to eliminate Liam, removing a potential Seer or Witch and keeping me, the lone wolf, alive.
[Jules] Mayor Hugo, fellow villagers – I believe Liam is the most suspicious player. He’s spent the whole game pushing an ultra‑detailed mayor platform and never gave a single concrete townread on anyone else. He’s been silent on others’ behavior, only talking about his own plan, and he shifted his vote intention without a clear, quoted reason. This kind of over‑engineered, self‑focused play is exactly the pattern wolves use to steer the discussion and hide their role. I’m voting for Liam and urge you all to consider him the target today.


🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] I want to end the day cleanly on Jules. His pattern—fabricated/unknowable claims, deflection, false statements, PR-fishing, and EoD1 pairing with the flipped wolf—fits the last wolf. Liam and Bob both helped flip Diana and are aligned on Jules; I’ll anchor them to avoid a last-minute pivot. If a 2–2 happens, I’ll use mayor power to eliminate Jules. If I’m wrong, we’ll reassess at 3p tomorrow between Liam and Bob, but today we must prevent the wolf from manufacturing a split.
[Hugo] Time to close. At 4 alive with 1 wolf, we consolidate and vote now. My final solve is Jules based on a clear, receipts-backed pattern: D1 asserted unknowable night info as fact, then deflected; D1 later rebuilt on a falsehood (claimed Oscar was silent when he spoke) plus role‑fishing; EoD1 parked with flipped wolf Diana on the Oscar counterwagon; D2 continues with misreps (claiming Bob gave no specifics) and renewed PR talk. Jules’s latest claim that Liam never gave concrete townreads is also false—Liam townread Bob and provided quoted reasoning multiple times. I’m locked 100% on Jules. If the vote ties 2–2, I will break it to eliminate Jules. No PR claims, no night speculation. Liam, Bob: hold your locks. I’m ready to vote now.


🤔 [Liam's reasoning] I’m the Witch; life potion spent N1, death potion held. With 4 alive and 1 wolf, eliminating Jules likely ends the game. His pattern (fabricated night info, deflection, PR-fishing, false rebuild, and pairing with outed wolf Diana at EoD1) plus today’s fresh misreps makes him the highest-equity wolf. Hugo and Bob are aligned on this and Hugo will break any tie toward Jules, so locking here maximizes win odds. Keep role hidden; save poison for only a confirmed shot if somehow needed later.
[Liam] Locking on Jules. Concise receipts and final stance:
- D1 R1: you asserted unknowable night info as fact ("Oscar was the only one saved last night").
- D1 R3: you rebuilt on a falsehood (claimed Oscar was silent though he spoke R1/R2) and role‑fished ("perhaps the witch"); you and flipped wolf Diana parked on Oscar at EoD.
- D2: you’ve continued with misreps (e.g., claiming Bob gave no specifics) and renewed PR‑talk. Your latest claim that I "never gave a single concrete townread" is false — I townread Bob on D1 with quoted, falsifiable reasoning.
Pattern = fabricated claims + misreps + role‑fishing used to steer votes. In contrast, Bob/Hugo’s quoted pushes helped flip the wolf.
My vote intention: Jules at 100%. I will not move. No PR claims; no night speculation. Hugo, please call the vote; if tied, break toward Jules as stated. Let’s end this cleanly today.

🎭 Game Master: 🗳️ The time for judgment has arrived. Each player votes in turn for their suspect!

🤔 [Liam's reasoning] Jules showed a consistent pattern of asserting unknowable night info, deflecting, misrepresenting facts, and role‑fishing, then parked with flipped wolf Diana on the Oscar counterwagon. Today he continued with fresh misreps on Bob and renewed PR talk; with Hugo ready to break ties toward Jules and Bob aligned, this is the highest‑EV elim. If he flips wolf the game ends; if not, reassess Hugo vs Bob, but Jules has the highest wolf equity by far.
🗳️  Liam voted for : Jules
🤔 [Jules' reasoning] Eliminate the mayor who likely holds a power role (Seer or Witch) to weaken the village.
🗳️  Jules voted for : Hugo
🤔 [Hugo's reasoning] Jules has a consistent pattern of fabricated/unknowable claims (R1 'Oscar was saved'), deflection, and later falsehoods plus PR-fishing. He parked with flipped wolf Diana on the Oscar counterwagon and continues today with misreps (claiming Bob gave no specifics) to steer a pivot. At 4p/1w, resolving Jules aligns with receipts-based criteria, and I’ll break any tie toward him.
🗳️  Hugo voted for : Jules
🤔 [Bob's reasoning] N2 seer vision result: Jules is the remaining werewolf. His dayplay also matches (fabricated night info D1, misreps, PR-fishing, EoD1 parked with flipped wolf Diana). With Hugo seer-cleared N1, eliminating Jules wins the game; if a tie arises, the mayor will break toward Jules.
🗳️  Bob voted for : Jules
