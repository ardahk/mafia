Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [17:28:03].\n"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "The current time is [17:30:13].\nHere is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:\n[17:28:03] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.\n[17:28:02] Sidney: Hello!\n[17:28:10] Tyler: Hiii\n[17:28:10] Brook: Hiii\n[17:28:12] Harley: Yo\n[17:28:17] Ari: Hello!\n[17:28:26] Ari: Let's start this game\n[17:28:29] Bailey: i'm here let's get started\n[17:28:30] Harley: It's clear that Brook is sus\n[17:28:35] Sidney: I'm Sidney Swiney\n[17:28:38] Ari: For sure\n[17:28:39] Ashton: hiii\n[17:28:40] Tyler: lol\n[17:28:43] Brook: why?\n[17:28:47] Ari: Sidney has great genes\n[17:28:47] Tyler: do you have great genes?\n[17:28:50] Harley: Crystal clear\n[17:28:54] Sidney: I do\n[17:28:55] Ari: We are all on the same page\n[17:29:01] Bailey: harley why do you think brook is suspicious\n[17:29:06] Harley: Sidney do me a kid\n[17:29:12] Ashton: we are all from the same planet\n[17:29:20] Tyler: what planet is that\n[17:29:26] Bailey: harley needs to explain what makes brook suspicious\n[17:29:26] Sidney: Sure Harley, but only if you are a Bystander\n[17:29:37] Harley: it's that actually Bailey is sus\n[17:29:38] Sidney: Are you?\n[17:29:41] Tyler: She must be a mobster\n[17:29:52] Bailey: harley still hasn't explained anything about brook being suspicious\n[17:29:59] Harley: It's Bailey\n[17:30:02] Ari: Harley just accused someone, didn't explain and then accused the one who noticed\n[17:30:03] Harley: bote for Bailey\n[17:30:03] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote!
