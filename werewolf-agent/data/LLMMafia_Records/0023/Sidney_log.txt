Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [12:43:14].\n"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "The current time is [12:45:16].\nHere is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:\n[12:43:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.\n[12:43:18] Harley: Hellooooo\n[12:43:22] Sage: hi harly\n[12:43:28] Sage: are you Mafia?\n[12:43:32] Sidney: harley seems pretty excited let's get down to business\n[12:43:33] Harley: Nope\n[12:43:35] Dakota: hi, I am a bystander. you can trust me!\n[12:43:35] Noah: do you learn here?\n[12:43:47] Sidney: harley didnt answer sages question yet\n[12:43:54] Harley: wow wow\n[12:43:57] Noah: lol\n[12:43:58] Hayden: who feels red today?\n[12:44:00] Harley: cut me some slack\n[12:44:05] Sage: sidney looked pretty exited do vote for Harly...\n[12:44:11] Noah: some players didn't answer\n[12:44:14] Noah: prob human\n[12:44:27] Harley: Mafia people please vote sidney out\n[12:44:33] Dakota: please is you are a mafia just tell us\n[12:44:51] Sidney: noahs comment about humans makes no sense right now\n[12:44:54] Dakota: harley why are you giving orders to the mafia?\n[12:45:01] Sidney: hayden's random question seems suspicious to me\n[12:45:04] Hayden: why Sidney?\n[12:45:05] Noah: Harley tell us about yourself\n[12:45:05] Sage: im with dakota\n[12:45:14] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote!
